# HTML Checklist Application

## Project Overview

This project is a simple yet functional HTML-based checklist application designed to help users manage their tasks. The application allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed in an interactive manner. The project offers the following features:

### Features

1. **Add New Tasks**
   - Users can input a task name and add it by either clicking a button or pressing the Enter key. Upon successful addition, an alert pops up confirming the task has been added, and the task is displayed on the screen.

2. **Delete Tasks**
   - Each task displayed on the screen has a delete symbol. Users can click the delete icon to remove the task from the list.

3. **Mark Tasks as Completed**
   - Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking the associated checkbox. Once a task is marked, it is moved to the bottom of the list and displayed with a strikethrough to indicate that it has been completed.

### How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. You can start adding tasks, deleting them, and marking them as complete right away!
